	Backup systems are an important part of any IT infrastrucutre. They provide data assurance in the face of faulty hardware and software. Nonetheless, computer users commonly rely on backup systems that fail to exhibit either reliability, accessibility, security, or a combination of all three. We work to resolve this issue by creating a storage system in which users share encrypted data fragments amongst each other instead of with a single data storage entity. If data is corrupted on any single storage device, the data may be restored from a set of other storage devices.  Furthermore, the architecture of this sytem enhances security and privacy.  This is because in our Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network there is no single organizing entity or corporation that controls all the data.  Therefore, there is no single target that hackers or governments can attack to steal data.  Our P2P system is different from already existing systems such as BitTorrent, because it focuses on the task of backing up and storing data instead of the task of streaming data.
